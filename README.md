## Notes

Please note that there still is some uncertainty regarding the role of
labialized stops in the data and, in particular, their phonemic value.

Languages of the Uto-Aztecan family are routinely described as distinguishing,
at the phonemic level, between labialized and non-labialized stops, both
simple and geminate (see, among others, Campbell 1997 and Dayley 1989). In
face of this, and also considering that the raw data clearly distinguishes
in its source (entered in LaTeX TIPA) between normal and superscript "w",
it was decided, not without doubts, to carry all superscript "w" as
diacritic markers for labialization, even though they might very well be
artefacts of data entering from multiple sources (please refer to
discussion at https://github.com/lexibank/wheelerutoaztecan/pull/5).
